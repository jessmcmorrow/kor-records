        <p>KOR! is an independent record label that creates music projects for young people with additional support needs & releases their output.</p>

        <p>
            Every project is different, just like every young artist we work with is different. We always aim to be responsive to the needs and interests of our participants, and this means the output
            of a project depends on who is making it. So far we have created; EPs, singles, music videos, zines, documentaries and live performances. Our projects have taken place in schools, community
            centres and art venues.

                We want to offer an alternative to the fame and money-driven commercial music industry. We want to offer the experience of being in a band and making music to people who are often excluded.
                We want to experiment with methods of making music collaboratively. We want to increase the number of musicians with additional support needs and their audiences.
