Young Artists Programme is a continuation of projects started over the past 4 years, supporting the experimental music making of young musicians with additional support needs. Currently, KOR! Records works with young people through two projects in Glasgow and one in West Lothian. Each group experiment with sound, explore ways of collaborating and listening, and create new music and noise. Working with KOR! Records staff and guest musicians the groups work towards creating and sharing their creative output. Previously this has been through the creation of a music video, a live performance or an EP release.</p>

It is also a showcase of new collaborations between artists, and a gig event designed to be accessible to a wide audience of experimental music fans.</p>

                Every project is different, just like every young artist we work with is different. We always aim to be responsive to the needs and interests of our participants, and this means the output
                of a project depends on who is making it. So far we have created; EPs, singles, music videos, zines, documentaries and live performances. Our projects have taken place in schools, community
                centres and art venues.
